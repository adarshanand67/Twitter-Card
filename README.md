# Twitter-Card

The Twitter Card is a reusable React component that displays a tweet in a card format with customizable details and buttons for likes, comments, and retweets. It is designed to resemble the Twitter UI and can be easily integrated into any React project.

## Installation

``` git clone https://github.com/adarshanand67/Twitter-Card/```

## Usage

To use the Twitter Card component in your React application, import it into your component and pass the necessary props:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import TwitterCard from '@your-username/twitter-card';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <TwitterCard
      name="John Doe"
      handle="@johndoe"
      tweet="This is an example tweet!"
      time="3:30 PM - 5 Jan 2022"
      avatar="https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
      likes={42}
      retweets={23}
      comments={17}
    />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

The `TwitterCard` component takes the following props:

- `name`: the name of the tweet author
- `handle`: the Twitter handle of the tweet author
- `tweet`: the text content of the tweet
- `time`: the timestamp of the tweet
- `avatar`: the URL of the tweet author's avatar image
- `likes`: the number of likes for the tweet
- `retweets`: the number of retweets for the tweet
- `comments`: the number of comments for the tweet

In this example, the TwitterCard component will have a light gray background color.
